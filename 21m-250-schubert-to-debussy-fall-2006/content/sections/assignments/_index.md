Students are required to write three concert reports during the term. These reports constitute the written component of the class; each is to be about 5 pages long. At least one of the concerts must occur "off-campus" and at least two must involve professional musicians. While it is rare for a concert to feature only Romantic music, those you choose to write about should present at least one major work by a composer in the class syllabus.
